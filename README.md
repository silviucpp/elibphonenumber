elibphonenumber
===============

Erlang port of [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber).

##Note

- This project is active. I'm doing updates very offen because I see the original author is no longer maintaining it.
- This repository is a fork of [silviucpp/elibphonenumber][3], except this version is designed to be used with rebar3.

## Compile

You need compile `libphonenumber` and install it before compiling the project. You can read up on how people have done this on the [wiki.][2]

## Run the tests

```sh
rebar3 compile
rebar3 eunit
```
